## My Opinion

### Passage 1

As you can see, extroverts and introverts are roughly evenly represented in positions of importance. It's true that "leadership" isn't about extroversion or introversion, but having the right personality goes a long way toward managing.

People with this type of personality are called ambiverts, meaning they can regulate their extroversion/introversion at the right time. In important positions, this ability is very important. Because as a worker, you need to communicate completely differently with your leader and your employees, it can be helpful to regulate your own personality appropriately.
